<h3>February 4, 2016</h3>

<p>Day 1. It's me Drake. I was messing around on my computer and I must've hit
the wrong button because now I've been shrunk down to the size of a tiny snail.
My body is too small to press the ctrl and z keys at the same time. I don't even 
know how I'm typing this right now. My only hope
is to make my way to the backspace key and hope it has the power to undo my
terrible mistakes. Right now I'm on the 1 key on the other side of the computer.
All I have is:</p>
<ul>
<li>my clothes</li>
<li>pocket lint</li>
<li>used napkin</li>
<li>green CrayolaTM crayon</li>
<li>my ability to lay down hot tracks</li>
<li>a stress ulcer</li>
</ul>
<p>The backspace key is so far away, and I'm so tired from having undergone such
a miraculous transformation. There's no food or water around for yards and yards.
Please send help, or at least a breadcrumb, somebody.</p>



<p>As Drake once said, <q>Help! I'm a tiny Drake!</q></p>

<h3>February 14, 2016</h3>

<p>Day 11. Decided to go off my route because I just couldn't pass up the chance
to stand on a giant K. Yeah I know it's not giant, I'm just the size of a very 
small ladybug. After all the letter K is in my name. I'm Drake. Although I wonder
occasionally if I ceased to be who I once was when I shrunk myself down to this
ridiculous size. I can't drop hot singles so am I still Drake? This blog is called
<em>HELP It's Me, Drake</em> but is it truly me, Drake? I need to meditate
on this K to remind myself who I used to be. It's Valentine's Day. I'm so alone, I miss
my girl but I would totally make out with a ladybug right now. Gonna start working
on a hot new track about how much I miss my girl and want to make out with a ladybug.</p>

<h3>February 21, 2016</h3>

<p>Day 18. Well I've made it to the backspace key and I'm ready to backspace my mistakes.
Upscale myself, get back into the up-space above. It's actually going to be kind
of hard leaving my ladybug girlfriend behind. I wish I could bring her with me into the 
realm of human-sized things but I have no idea how to do that. I actually don't even
know if I'm going to be able to get back there myself. But I can't think about
that right now. I've gotta stay positive, visualize the goal. Normal-sized Drake
laying down some hot tracks. I've even got a whole list of things that I'm gonna
do when I get back. (I wrote them on the napkin with the crayon)</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab a hot slice of cheese pizza</li>
<li>Bat a fresh lime out of Fenway Park</li>
<li>Blow a kiss to every ladybug</li>
<li>Lay down my newest album of hot tracks, <em>Ladybug Breakup</em></li>
<li>Make a bunch of money</li>
<li>Spend the money on a new computer that doesn't have a shrink function</li>
</ol>

<p>Alright, here I go. It's just like that old poem.</p>
<blockquote>... burn and Drake at close of day; Drake, Drake
 against the dying of the light. Do not go gentle into that
Drake night. </blockquote>

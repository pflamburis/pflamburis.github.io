<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed 
and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with
me. I've got my...</p>

<ul>
<li>cellphone</li>
<li>iPod</li>
<li>digital camera</li>
<li>and a protein bar</li>
</ul>

<p>Just the essentials! As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles
begins with one step; Segway.</q></p>

<p>I saw some Burman Shave signs on the road today: <blockquote>Passing cars, when you can't 
see, may you get a glimpse of eternity.</blockquote> I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

<p>Well, I've made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting
places on the way.</p>

<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
<li>Magic City, ID</li>
<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
